# Learning Objectives

This lesson defines what a swap is and types of swaps.
In addition, it provides background on the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).

This lesson addresses the following course objective:
- Identify fundamental concepts of swaps

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:
- Identify the common types of swaps and key differences

<h3> What is a swap? </h3>

A Swap is an agreement between two counterparties to exchange a series of payments over a specified period of time, based on reference rates (interest rates, currencies, commodities, indices) applied to a notional amount.

There are several reasons why swaps are used:
- Swap in/out exposures such as interest risk, market value, default risk, credit risk
- Convert a fixed or floating cash stream into the other

<h3> Types of swaps </h3>

There are several types of swaps, each with unique differences.

<table>
<tr>
    <td>Interest rate swaps</td>
    <td>An interest rate swap is an agreement, whereby two parties (counterparties) enter into an agreement to exchange periodic interest payments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Swaption</td>
    <td>
        <p>A swaption is an option to enter into a swap -- typically an interest swap.</p>
        <p>The purchaser, in exchange for the option premium, gets the right, but not the obligation, to enter into an interest rate swap at a present rate, within a specific period of time.</p>
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Total return swap (TR)</td>
    <td>
        <p>A total return swap is where one party agrees to pay the other the positive return of a defined underlying asset (or receive in the event of negative return), in return for receiving a stream of cash flows (usually LIBOR-based), which represents a financing cost.
        </p>
        <p>
        The party designated to receive the positive return would in turn have to pay a negative return in addition to the LIBOR payments.
        </p>
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Credit default swap (CDS)</td>
    <td>
        <p> 
        A credit default swap (CDS) is entered into when one party seeks to protect himself against the risk of default on a particular bond ("protection buyer"), by agreeing to pay a counterparty ("protection seller") a series of premium payments. The "protection seller" would make a lump-sum payment to the protection buyer, in the event of a default of the bond.

        Note: credit default swaps are not covered in this course.

<h3> The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) </h3>

<p>
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) is the leading global trade association representing participants in the privately negotiated derivatives sector, a business which includes interest rate, currency, commodity and equity swaps, as well as related products such as caps, collars, floors and swaptions.
</p>
<p>
ISDA was chartered in 1985 and today numbers over 850 member institutions from around the world. These members include most of the world's major institutions who deal in,  as well as leading end-users of, privately negotiated derivatives.
</p>


<p>
<u>Note</u>: 
The primary function of the ISDA is to promote practices conducive to the efficient conduct of the business of its members in swaps and other derivates, including the development and maintenance of standard documentation for derivatives and to foster high standards of commercial honor and business conduct among its members.

<h3>OTC derivatives reform overview</h3>

<p>
There has been some changes due to OTC reform. Many products - such as certain single name and index CDS positions and certain vanilla IRS positions - are now being centrally-cleared.
</p>

<h4>Key features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mandatory clearing, electronic trading and reporting</li>
<li>Increased regulatory oversight</li>
<li>Creation of new designations for market participants</li>
<li>Increased margin and capital requirements</li>
<li>Enhanced governance/compliance structures for market particpants</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key considerations:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Higher margining and collateral requirements</li>
<li>Minimum capital thresholds</li>
<li>Diminished liquidity of derivative markets</li>
<li>Registration and substantial compliance requirements</li>
<li>Impact on business model, legal organizational structure and business processes/IT</li>
<li>Adequacy of reporting, models and data quality</li>
</ul>

<h4>Implementation challenges:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rule-making still in progress with rules in various stages of approval</li>
<li>Overlapping regulation and requirements (SEC vs. CFTC)</li>
<li>Significant systems, process and behavioral changes</li>
<li>Legal entity rationalization and attendant "repapering" of trades</li>
<li>Pending International OTC Regulatory reform legislations (MIFiD II, EMIR and Asian regulations)</li>
</ul>
